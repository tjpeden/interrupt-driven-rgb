![Prototype]({{site.baseurl}}/images/rgb_photos/prototype.jpg)

This is version 2 of the prototype. We were using an Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V but needed more memory so we switched to the Teensy 3.1. It was a bit of a Hail Mary play as we made this decision 2 weeks before we needed to deploy the box. Turns out, it was a brilliant choice.

![Close up; Measuring current]({{site.baseurl}}/images/rgb_photos/measuring_current_close.jpg)

This was my initial effort at measuring the current consumption in different states. It comsumed less than 100mA with everything on, and 10mA with all but the screen in sleep mode (due to library constraints). We haven't had a chance to measure the current consumption of the actual box with the MOSFETs and we probably won't.

We tested the fit of the screen and button after we cut the holes with the laser cutter.

![Box stained]({{site.baseurl}}/images/rgb_photos/stained.jpg)

The box was stained and lacquered before the electronics were installed.

![Screen support structure]({{site.baseurl}}/images/rgb_photos/screen_support_structure.jpg)

We tested out the support structure for the screen and GPS module. Popsicle sticks and hot glue for the win!

TJ spent quite a number of hours soldering the connections between all of the modules.

Everything soldered and glued into place inside the box.

The box powers up as expected. We were pretty excited to see this!

Writing the firmware to the microcontroller. We had to fix a few bugs in the code as well.

Now it's time to construct the insert that will hold the right and cover most of the electronics.

All finished and ready to be armed and deployed!

Patrick deployed the box with lots of maps, a compass and a drafting compass to make sure his girlfriend could find each destination without too much trouble. She also had her phone for Google Maps and Navigation.

This is her reaction to receiving this mysterious box.

This is her with the box at the first waypoint.
