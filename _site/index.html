  <p>What is that, you say? In the simplest of terms, it's like a regular geocache, except you start with the cache locked in a box that is location aware (it has a GPS). You take the box to the appropriate location and it will open up! How do you know what location to take it to, you ask? There is a screen on the top of the box which tells you what direction to go and how far to go in that direction. It's probably best to use Google Maps to try to determine where you really need to go as it only gives you simple distance and direction. Sounds cool, huh?</p>

  <p>Oh, you've seen these before? What's so special about our box? We decided to take it a couple steps further. First, we chose to handle power conservation differently. Second, the box doesn't just open when you get to the designated location. It's programming allows for multiple locations to be set and the box only opens once you get to the last location. I know what you're thinking, it's sounds like more trouble than it's worth. Well, there's a reason for all of the different locations. The box has a greater purpose.</p>

  <a name="the-technical-details" class="anchor" href="#the-technical-details"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Technical Details</h2>

  <p>All the other RGB projects I've seen use a Pololu switch to cut power to the MCU. While that is extremely effective, it's also kind of boring. We use low power modules with sleep functions to reduce their power consumption when not in use. It also sports a USB charging circuit so that the 2500mAh battery is ready when you need it. The display is a full color 1.5" OLED with a handy microSD card slot on the bottom. The location data is stored on the card so that it can be easily configured and tweaked before it's deployed.</p>

  <p>TJ Peden (<a href="https://github.com/tpeden" class="user-mention">@tpeden</a>) is the Engineer and Developer of the project. Patrick Reames (<a href="https://github.com/patrickr" class="user-mention">@patrickr</a>) designed and planned the project and as soon as it's completed, he will be the one to deploy the box. More on that in the weeks to come!</p>
